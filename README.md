# How it work
This is a simple script that keep you alive by quiting the game before you die.
It look at your life and check if it passed a threshold (default is 35% life). When it does it save&quit.

This is not intented for online usage!  
Also i do advise testing it on a softcore character before using it on a hardcore üòÅ

### Usage
Click on the `run.cmd` to automaticly launch diablo 2 and the bot together. This is more convenient than having to think about launch the bot each time to launch diablo 2. You can make a shortcut from it directly to your desktop

# Demo

# Configuration
in the folder there is `config.yml` file that should look like this:
```
QuitOnHealthPercentage: 35
QuitMethod: Both # Other values are: Socket, Menu
# If you receive a hit that put you with less life than the hit you took then it will quit
# this can increase survivability when QuitOnHealthPercentage is too low
QuitOnMajorHit: true 
```
the number is the percentage of life at which the script will quit.

# States

*Looking for player*

This mean that the bot is searching for your player. If you are not in a game this is normal. If you are this mean there is a problem.

*In town*

When you are safe in town you don't need to quit if your life is under the threshold. So it won't do anything in that state.

*Watching you*

If you are out then it will be in that state and quit if your life goes under the threshold.
